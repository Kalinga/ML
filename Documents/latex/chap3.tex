\chapter{Proposal and Methodology}


\section{Terminology}
In the current work and by other authors also training and learning is used interchangeably. Let me loosely define some frequently used terms and concepts in the Machine Learning arena.
\\*\textbf{Epoch:}
During the learning the network sees the set of samples several times. During the training, presenting the network entire set of sample once is known as an epoch. So an epoch represents one iteration over entire dataset.
\\*\textbf{Batch and batch size:}
Mainly because of two reasons we can not pass the entire dataset to the network for the training purpose at once. Firstly, datasets by nature most of the time are huge. Let it be image data or some other textual data, in many scenarios it is not possible to feed all the data because of hardware constraints, such as not enough RAM to hold entire dataset.
Secondly to update weight during training process, network has to wait for a very very long time to calculate the delta weight after processing all the input data. To solve this problem usually the full dataset is split into several small batches and number of samples within each small batch is known as 
Batch and batch size.
\\*\textbf{Iterations:} 
Number of batches that a neural network process to complete a single epoch.
The number of  iterations, batch size and  number of data samples in the dataset is given by, the below expression.
\begin{equation}
    D = B * I
\end{equation}
Where D is the total number of samples in the dataset.
\\*B is the number of samples in the mini batch that is fed to the network at once.
\\*I is the  total number of batches the network process in a single epoch.

Larger batch size requires more computational resource and achieves faster completion, in contrast smaller batch size leads to more generalization. In this regards, Yann  LeCun humorously said
\begin{quote}
``Training with large mini batches is bad for your health. More importantly, it's bad for your test error.  Friends, don't let friends use mini batches larger than 32.''
\end{quote}   
The empirical study of the performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent in \cite{masters2018revisiting} show that, the team obtained the best training stability and generalization performance using small batch sizes, for a given computational cost, across a wide range of experiments they conducted. In all cases they have achieved the best results with batch sizes m = 32 or smaller.
\\*\textbf{Intersection Over Union:}
Intersection Over Union (IOU) is a measure similar to Jaccard Index that measures the overlap ratio between two bounding boxes. It evaluates the ratio between area of  overlapping area between two BBs and area of union between them.

\begin{equation}
    IoU = \frac{area\: of\: overlap} {area\: of\: union} =
\end{equation}

\section{Data Acquisition}

Overview of caltech dataset
 \cite{dollar2011pedestrian}
which  includes   350,000  pedestrianbounding boxes (BB) labeled in 250,000 frames and remainsthe largest  such data  set to  date.

Challenges are there while just considering image data, 
the verities of image sources for example we can get photos that are taken by 
professionals, synthetic photos drawn by image generators and real life photos 
that we see and capture in our day to day life. So the results of these benchmarks and 
observation across these aforementioned classes of data set does not transfer to the other scenarios.

As already mentioned by \cite{walk2010new} Caltech data set is difficult for various reasons.
Many small pedestrians
realistic occlusion frequency
image quality is poor
includes blur
visible JPEG artifacts

\newpara
In our training data we had total number of BB for Person as a label=153234
sample data looks as below:
%frame,xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,class_id
%set00_V000_1213.png,573,591,169,211,1
%set00_V000_1213.png,473,484,170,193,1

%set00_V000_166.png,233,241,120,134,1
%set00_V000_744.png,564,588,153,218,1

%set00_V000_654.png,406,417,162,194,1
In 61439 unique images.
There are 72933 BB whose height is less than 50. As per \cite{walk2010new}, they considered 50-pixel-or-taller, unoccluded pedestrians, as they are not clear. Removing those BB where the height is less than 5o pixel, we are left with 80301 BBs in 37181 unique frames.
%df_with_height = df[(df['height'] >= 50) == True]
%df_with_width = df[(df['width'] <= 10) == True], gave us 519 such BBs where the width of the BB is less than or equals to 10 pixel. We also discarded such labels from our input training data set. We are finally left with 79831 BBs in 37081 unique frames.


\section{JAAD}
\cite{rasouli2017agreeing} JAAD contains 650 samples of pedestrian behavior under various street and weather condition..
