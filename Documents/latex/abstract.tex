In the recent times, Deep Learning plays a significant role in the computer vision-related tasks and Deep learning-based algorithms such as 'Convolutional Neural Networks'
(CNN) demonstrated and proven to be outperforming other state-of-art models when 
deployed in object detection tasks. In the recent past, many researchers have shown great 
deals towards image classification and object detection problems. Also, there exist several 
well-benchmarked results in the context of image classification and objects in image detection.
In comparison, usage of deep learning to solve problems that involve prediction of pedestrian future location or user behavior from a monitored video is much less investigated.

\noindent During my master thesis, various aspects related to image classification, object 
detection and object tracking in a video have been studied with a special focus on pedestrian trajectory prediction. 
A new state refinement module was proposed is proposed and the results for pedestrian trajectory 
tasks with varying \textit{input} and \textit{future-time-frame} are presented.
