In the recent times, Deep Learning plays a significant role in the computer vision
related tasks and Deep learning based algorithms such as 'Convolutional Neural Networks'
(CNN) demonstrated and proven to be outperforming other state-of-art models when 
deployed in object detection tasks. In the recent past many researchers shown great 
deals towards image classification and object detection problems. Also there exists several 
benchmarks in the context of classification and objects in an image detection. In 
comparison, usage of deep learning to solve problems that involves prediction of 
user behavior from a monitored video is much less investigated.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent During my Master Thesis, various aspects related to image classification, object 
in image detection and object tracking in a video and prediction of user behavior 
have been studied with a particular focus on Pedestrian trajectory prediction. 
A new prediction model is proposed and the results for pedestrian trajectory 
task are presented.
