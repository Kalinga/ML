It is determined by the center location error, which computes the average
euclidean distance between the center locations of the tracked targets and the ground truth
positions of all the frames. When a tracking algorithm loses track of a target object, the
output location can be random, and thus, the average error value does not measure the
tracking performance correctly [17]. If the estimated locations are within a given threshold
distance of the ground-truth would be evaluated, it would be more accurate evaluation

\section{Old Text}
In general we can think of two types activity prediction, (i) early activity detection (ii) future activity prediction. In the case of early activity detection, the class label of an action is inferred at the point when the activity starts or shortly after the activity started. Where as in the future activity prediction, the class label of the action that will happen next is predicted and also the starting time in the future is also predicted.
