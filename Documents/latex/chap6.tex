In general we can think of two types activity prediction, (i) early activity detection (ii) future activity prediction. In the case of early activity detection, the class label of an action is inferred at the point when the activity starts or shortly after the activity started. Where as in the future activity prediction, the class label of the action that will happen next is predicted and also the starting time in the future is also predicted.
